        "Urano, a book-loving certified librarian who had just settled on a job at a university library, happened to die following her college graduation. Upon reincarnating, she finds herself as the daughter of a soldier in a world with few books and a poor literacy rate. No matter how much she wants to read, she canâ€™t expect to find anything like a book. In that case, what will she do? Why not just make them? She aims to become a librarian! In order to live a life surrounded by books, she sets out to create them herself.",
        "Note: The main character starts out as a pretty terrible person. Until she grows out of it, the mood of the story is in danger of getting even worse. (Rated 15+ just in case.)"
